# Fractal Weekends

Each weekend, I share a new type of fractal: generator, style, animation, and all the code needed to reproduce it.

##  Current Fractal: Burning Ship

All the following visuals are located in the [`buring_ship/`](./buring_ship) directory.

## Features

- Python-based fractal generation
- High-res outputs (4K+)
- Domain coloring, super-sampling, distance estimation
- Parallel rendering (`multiprocessing`)
- Artistic styles: noise, glow, sparkles, gradients
