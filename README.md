# Fractal Weekends

A personal collection of fractal explorations â€” every weekend, I experiment with a new fractal type, render it in high resolution, and share the code behind it.

##  Structure

Each fractal type lives in its own folder (e.g. `burning_ship/`, `julia/`, `mandelbrot/`, etc.), and contains:

- `script_<name>.py` â€“ the full Python script to generate the fractal  
- `README.md` â€“ short description and instructions  
- `examples/` â€“ high-res outputs and animations

##  Features

- 4K rendering with smooth coloring and super-sampling  
- Custom palettes (e.g. `inferno` from `matplotlib`)  
- Glow, sparkles, domain coloring, and more  
- Parallelized computation for heavy fractals (`multiprocessing`)
